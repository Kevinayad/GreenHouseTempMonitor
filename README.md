# GreenHouseTempMonitor
<h1>Made by Kevin Ayad - ka223hr<br></h1>
This is an IOT project to measure and monitor temperature and humidity in greenhouses to help farmers take better care of their crops and produce higher-quality fruits, veggies, and herbs.
<br>An individual with a beginner to intermediate understanding of IOT shall be able to set up this project in under 2 hours.
<h1>Objective</h1>
This project will help farmers understand the temperature and humidity of their greenhouses to take better care of their plants, this information will let them know how to water and treat the plants differently based on the temperature and humidity.<br> Furthermore this project could be further improved by adding a feature that triggers a watering system to the plants upon user request, possibly after receiving a notification of increased temperature in real-time.<br>
